### ðŸ”Ž Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end churn analysis pipeline using SQL Server, Power BI, and Machine Learning (Python). It covers the full lifecycle from ETL and data cleaning â†’ dashboard creation â†’ insights â†’ predictive modeling.

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
1. SQL Server â€“ ETL, data storage, cleaning, creating views
2. Power BI â€“ Data modeling, dashboard visualization, AI insights
3. Python (Jupyter Notebook) â€“ Machine learning with Random Forest

### ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
1. Data Preparation (SQL Server)
2. Created database & staging tables.
3. Cleaned null values, standardized data types.
4. Built production tables & SQL views for churned/joined customers.
5. Data Exploration (SQL Queries)
6. Distribution checks: gender, contracts, tenure, states.
7. Null analysis & replacements.
8. Created age/tenure group buckets.

Power BI Dashboard

KPIs: total customers, churn count, churn rate, new joiners.

Demographics: gender, age groups.

Account info: payment methods, contract type, tenure.

Geography: top churn states.

Churn drivers: churn category, churn reasons.

Services: adoption vs churn (matrix view).

Interactivity: slicers, tooltips, AI insights.

# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis â€“ Insights & Recommendations
## ðŸ”Ž Executive Summary

Our churn analysis identified key customer groups, behaviors, and service factors contributing to a 17.5% churn rate. Insights suggest churn is driven by contract type, competitor offers, early tenure disengagement, and service quality gaps.

1. Overall Churn
Churn Rate: ~17.5% of total customers.
Implication: High churn for a subscription business â†’ urgent need for targeted retention strategies.
2. Demographic Insights
Key Segment at Risk:
Female customers aged 50+ show significantly higher churn.
Primary reasons might include that competitor are offering betters offers as well as better devices.
Recommendation:
Design loyalty campaigns for senior female customers.
Introduce device upgrade programs and exclusive bundled deals.
3. Account Information
Contract Type:
Month-to-month contracts shows the highest churn rate which contributes around 51%.
Annual contracts show much lower churn.
ðŸ“Œ Recommendation: Incentivize customers to migrate to annual/long-term plans (e.g., discounts, free months).
Tenure:
Customers with <6 months tenure churn the most.
After 24 months, churn stabilizes.
ðŸ“Œ Recommendation: Focus on onboarding and engagement in the first 6 months to reduce early exits.
Payment Methods:
Higher churn in electronic check payments.
ðŸ“Œ Recommendation: Encourage auto-pay/credit card adoption with small perks.
4. Geographic Insights
Top 5 states consistently show the highest churn, regardless of demographics.
ðŸ“Œ Recommendation: Launch regional retention campaigns and prioritize service quality improvements in these states.
5. Churn Drivers
Competitor Impact:
180 customers churned due to better devices from competitors.
183 churned due to better offers.
ðŸ“Œ Recommendation: Launch competitive upgrade programs and promotional offers to counter competitor pull.
6. Service Insights
Low Adoption = Higher Churn Risk:
Customers not using device protection, online backup, online security, streaming music churn more often.
These services increase customer stickiness.
ðŸ“Œ Recommendation: Cross-sell these services aggressively.
High Adoption but High Churn = Quality Issues:
Services like Internet, Unlimited Data, Paperless Billing, Phone Services show churn despite high usage.
ðŸ“Œ Recommendation: Conduct service quality audits and improve customer experience in these areas.
7. AI & Predictive Insights
AI narrative visuals confirm trends (e.g., age >50 churn risk).
Planned Random Forest machine learning model will predict future churners at an individual customer level.
ðŸ“Œ Recommendation: Use ML predictions to proactively target at-risk customers before they leave.
### âœ… Strategic Recommendations
1. Focus on early tenure â€“ strong onboarding, engagement in first 6 months.
2. Promote long-term contracts â€“ reduce churn by locking in customers.
3. Target female customers 50+ â€“ personalized offers, device upgrade programs.
4. Compete on devices & bundles â€“ match competitor offers.
5. Improve service quality â€“ especially internet & phone.
6. Leverage cross-sell â€“ push security/backup/entertainment services.
7. Geographic campaigns â€“ focus on top churn states.
8. Adopt predictive churn modeling â€“ use Random Forest ML model for proactive retention.
